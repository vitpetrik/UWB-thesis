    "text": "2.1 Results\nAll proposed experiments were successfully conducted. The first experiment [Figure 2.2] showed that the UWB measurements are indeed precise and do not express any signs of nonlinearity. The maximum range of 120 m was reached by UWB, however, the measurements at the far end are not reliable and often drops out. This can be seen as straight lines in Figure 2.2.
