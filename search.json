    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been rapidly growing due to their versatility and wide range of applications, from aerial photography and surveillance to delivery services 1 and search and rescue operations [1]. The problem of relative localization in UAV swarms is a critical challenge for enabling cooperative behavior and avoiding collisions.\nTo address this problem, a novel system is proposed in this thesis that combines computer vision and ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for direction and range measurements, respectively. By fusing these measurements using a Kalman filter, the relative positions and orientations of UAVs can be estimated with high accuracy, even in GNSS-denied environments such as buildings or underground areas [1]. This approach has a significant advantage over existing methods, which often rely on GNSS [2] or motion capture 2 and are therefore limited in their ability to operate in challenging environments or without additional infrastructure onsite.\nThis thesis addresses designing and implementing an effective relative localization system for UAV swarms using computer vision and UWB technology, and evaluates how well does it perform in real-world scenarios. Firstly, a review of the proposed system and its key components, including the computer vision algorithms for direction estimation and the UWB hardware for range measurement, will be presented. Finally, the performance of the system will be evaluated through a series of experiments in both simulated and real-world environments.\nBy developing and testing this system, a contribution will be made to the growing body of research on multi-robot systems and pave the way for new applications of UAV swarms in challenging environments."

The MAC layer is responsible for coordinating access to the shared wireless channel, managing network associations and disassociations, and providing security and reliability features. The MAC layer inserts a MAC header and a MAC footer before and after a network-layer frame, respectively. The MAC header contains information such as frame type, source and destination addresses, sequence number, and security parameters. The MAC footer contains a CRC check. The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer supports two modes of operation: beacon-enabled and non-beacon-enabled. In beacon-enabled mode, a coordinator device periodically broadcasts beacons to synchronize the devices in its network and allocate contention-free periods for data transmission. In non-beacon-enabled mode, devices use a slotted or unslotted carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) mechanism to access the channel.

    "text": "3.2 Physical Layer\nThe physical (PHY) layer of UWB was described in IEEE 802.15.4-2011 [1] as UWB PHY. Later in IEEE 802.15.4-2015 [3] the PHY was named as High repetition pulse (HRP) UWB PHY. This decision was made due to the introduction of Low repetition pulse (LRP) UWB PHY. Only the HRP UWB PHY will be discussed. The standard defines three operation bands:\n\nsub-gigahertz band consisting of single a channel spectrum from 249.6 MHz to 749.6 MHz.\nLow band with spectrum from 3.1 GHz to 4.8 GHz.\nHigh band with spectrum from 6 GHz to 10.6 GHz.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Data flow according to [1].\n\n\nThe PHY uses an impulse radio signaling scheme with band-limited pulses and supports high data rates and precise ranging applications. It also uses a combination of burst position modulation (BPM) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) to modulate symbols. The overview of the physical layer is shown in figure 3.2.\n\nPPDU format\nEach physical layer protocol data unit (PPDU) consists of a preamble, PHY header, and the data itself. The process of encoding the whole PPDU can be seen in figure 3.3.\nReed-Solomon encoding is used to encode the physical service data unit (PSDU) of the HRP UWB PHY. It adds redundant symbols to the original message symbols to form a codeword that can be decoded using polynomial interpolation or factorization techniques. Reed-Solomon encoding improves the error-correction performance of the HRP UWB PHY and enables it to handle burst errors or random errors that may occur in the wireless channel 4.\nConvolutional encoding is used to encode the PSDU of the HRP UWB PHY after Reed-Solomon encoding. It uses a finite state machine with memory cells to generate output bits based on the current and previous input bits. It adds parity bits to the original information bits to form a codeword that can be decoded using Viterbi algorithm or other sequential decoding techniques. Convolutional encoding improves the error-correction performance of the HRP UWB PHY and enables it to handle noisy or fading channels.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: PPDU encoding process [1].\n\n\nA preamble in HRP UWB PHY is a sequence of known bits sent at the beginning of each frame. It is used for frame synchronization, channel estimation, and ranging measurements. It consists of two parts: a synchronization header (SHR) 3.4 and a physical layer header (PHR) 3.5.\nThe SHR contains a preamble symbol (SYNC) and a start-of-frame delimiter (SFD). The SFD is a fixed sequence of pulses that indicates the start of a frame. The PS is a burst of UWB pulses that can be modulated by burst position modulation (BPM) or binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). The preamble symbol repetitions (PSR) define the number of repeated sequences, ranging from 16 to 4,096 repetitions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: SHR field structure. [3]\n\n\nThe PHR contains information about the data to be received, including the length of the data and the data rate used to transmit the data. It also contains additional information elements to facilitate ranging information exchange\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: PHR field structure. [3]\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Symbol structure\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Symbol stucture. [3]\n\n\nA symbol is the basic unit of information in HWP UWB PHY. It consists of a short burst of UWB pulses that lasts for 2 ns and occupies a bandwidth of 0.5-1.3 GHz. The burst can be placed in one of the two possible burst intervals, and its phase can be inverted or not as can be seen in Figure 3.6. These two choices allow each symbol to carry two bits of information using burst position modulation (BPM) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), a example of the modulation can be found in figure 3.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Example of BPM-BPSK modulation,\n\n\n\nBurst hopping position is a parameter that determines the time position of the UWB pulses within a burst interval.

    "text": "3.3 Ranging techniques\n\nTime Difference of Arrival\nTime difference of arrival (TDOA) position estimation is a technique that uses the difference in the arrival times of UWB signals at multiple receivers to estimate the position of a transmitter.\nTDOA position estimation requires at least four receivers and one transmitter for 3D localization. The receivers measure the time of arrival (TOA) of the UWB signals. The TOA measurements are then used to calculate the TDOA values between different pairs of receivers [6].\n\\[\n    \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x_r}^T \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}} - \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x_i}^T \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}} = c(t_r - t_i)\n\\tag{3.5}\\] Where: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} &= \\text{estimated position of the transmitter.} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{x_r} &= \\text{Position of the reference receiver.} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{x_i} &= \\text{Position of receiver \\textit{i}.} \\\\\n    t_r &= \\text{Time of arrival for the reference receiver.} \\\\\n    t_r &= \\text{Time of arrival for the receiver \\textit{i}.} \\\\\n    c &= \\text{Speed of light.} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo estimate the position of the transmitter system of equations 3.5 is solved [4]. The main challenge for implementing TDoA is synchronizing the clock across all receivers [5].\nThe TDoA system can be used in a variety of applications, such as indoor positioning, tracking of vehicles or people, and asset tracking. The accuracy of the TDoA system depends on the number and placement of the UWB sensors and the timing resolution of the system.\n\n\nTwo-way ranging\nTwo-way ranging (TWR) is a technique used by UWB systems to estimate the distance between two devices. TWR requires two-way communication between two devices, where one device sends a signal to another device and waits for a response, as shown in figure 3.9. The time difference between the transmission and reception of the signal is used to calculate the distance between the two devices.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Two way ranging with two round trips.\n\n\nSingle-sided two-way ranging (SS-TWR) is a technique where only one device sends a signal and waits for a response from another device. The time difference between the transmission and reception of the signal is used to calculate the distance between the two devices.\n\\[\n    \\mathrm{TOF} = \\frac{R_a - D_b}{2}\n\\] Where: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathrm{TOF} &= \\text{Time of flight.} \\\\\n    R_a &= \\text{Time of round trip} \\\\\n    D_b &= \\text{Response delay.} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDouble-sided two-way ranging (DS-TWR) is a technique where both devices send signals and wait for responses from each other. The time difference between the transmission and reception of signals from both devices is used to calculate the distance between them.\n\\[\n    \\mathrm{TOF} = \\frac{R_a R_b - D_a D_b}{R_a + D_a + R_b + D_b}\n\\]\nDS-TWR’s main advantage is its ability to compensate for the effect of clock drift [2]. Clock drift refers to several related phenomena where a clock does not run at exactly the same rate as a reference clock. That is, after some time the clock “drifts apart” or gradually desynchronizes from the other clock. All clocks are subject to drift, causing eventual divergence unless resynchronized. Clock drift can be caused by many factors, such as temperature changes, aging of components, and power supply voltage changes [2].\n\n\n\n\n\n1. 2011.

Instead of matrix \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) 4.1 and \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) 4.2 known from LKF, the UKF is provided with nonlinear functions \\(\\mathbf{f(} \\mathbfcal{X} \\mathbf{)}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{h(} \\mathbfcal{X} \\mathbf{)}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n    \\textit{Predict step} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\mathbfcal{Y} = \\mathbf{f(} \\mathbfcal{X} \\mathbf{)} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2L} \\omega^m_i \\mathbfcal{Y}_i \\quad\\quad\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{P}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2L} \\omega^c_i (\\mathbfcal{Y}_i - \\mathbf{x})(\\mathbfcal{Y}_i - \\mathbf{x})^T + \\mathbf{Q}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nBy comparing the predicted measurements with the actual measurements, the UKF computes the Kalman gain, which determines the optimal blend between the predicted state and the measurement updates. Finally, the updated state estimate is obtained by incorporating the measurement information into the predicted state estimate using the Kalman gain. The update step of the UKF enables the filter to adaptively adjust the state estimate based on the measurements, providing a more accurate estimation of the system’s true state.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n    \\textit{Update step} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\mathbfcal{Z} = \\mathbf{h(} \\mathbfcal{X} \\mathbf{)} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{\\mu}_z = \\sum_{i=0}^{2L} \\omega^m_i \\mathbfcal{Z}_i \\quad\\quad\n    \\mathbf{P}_z = \\sum_{i=0}^{2L} \\omega^c_i (\\mathbfcal{Z}_i - \\mathbf{\\mu}_z)(\\mathbfcal{Z}_i - \\mathbf{\\mu}_z)^T + \\mathbf{R} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{\\mu}_z \\qquad \\mathbf{P}_{xz} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2L} \\omega_i^c (\\mathbfcal{X}_i - \\mathbf{x}) (\\mathbfcal{Z}_i - \\mathbf{\\mu}_z)^T \\\\\n    \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{P}_{xz} \\mathbf{P}_z^{-1} \\\\\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{y} \\qquad \\mathbf{\\hat{P}} = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{P}_z \\mathbf{K}^T\n\\end{gathered}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nThe UKF has been shown to achieve higher accuracy and robustness than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for various nonlinear estimation problems, such as state estimation, parameter estimation, and dual estimation [5].\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "5.1 DW1000 UWB PHY radio\nDW1000 is a UWB PHY radio developed and manufactured by Qorvo2. The proposed solution utilizes a development board Qorvo DWM1001-DEV which consists of a DWM1001C transceiver module and J-Link debug probe. Figure 5.2 showcases the printed circuit board (PCB) of the Qorvo DWM1001-DEV. The DWM1001C houses the DW1000 radio chip, nRF52832 micro-controller, 3.0 V and 1.8 V power supplies. The DW1000 is connected to nRF52832 via SPI bus. The module also includes bluetooth connectivity and accelerometer, but it remained unutilized.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Qorvo DWM1001 development board.\n\n\nThe nRF52832 is the micro-controller that gets programmed. The programming language of choice is C++ with combination of Zephyr RTOS3 which enables use of multi-tasking and concurrency. Zephyr RTOS also contains a rich selection of peripheral drivers for faster development and higher abstraction.\nA ranging technique of choice is double-sided two-way ranging. It fulfills all the needs as it compensates for clock drift and does not require any infrastructure. Each of the two devices in the ranging instance fills out fields in the ranging message 5.3. The values in the ranging message are referenced to DW1000 clock frequency. Therefore in order to get an actual time, the values need to be multiplied by \\(15.65 \\textrm{ ps}\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Structure of ranging message. Numbers denote bytes.\n\n\nData from UWB are sent to ROS via UART connection at baud rate 115200. As a communication protocol, the Baca Protocol is used as recommended by the MRS group4.\nUWB ranging on the ROS side handles uwb_range_node. The node decodes the messages and republishes them as a ROS topics. Every N seconds, the node sends a beacon message through the UWB. This message is then received and processed by other UAVs. An essential function of the beacon message is synchronizing UWB measurements with UVDAR measurements, enabling fusing the measurements based on IDs. This is done via UAV identificator that is embedded into the beacon message. The ID from beacon message is assigned to the MAC addresses in address resolution Table."

    "section": "5.2 Object tracker",
    "text": "5.2 Object tracker\nAn object tracker is a ROS node where the measurements are fused. Both linear and unscented Kalman filters are utilized in this node, as can be seen in figure 5.4. The fuse proceeds in the world frame to negate the effects of ego-motion.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Fuse of UVDAR and UWB measurements using Kalman filters.\n\n\nFor predict step, an implementation from LKF is used with state vector and transition matrix described by equations 5.1. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathbf{x} &= \\begin{bmatrix} x & y & z & roll & pitch & yaw \\end{bmatrix}^{T} \\\\ \\\\\n    \\mathbf{F} &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5.1}\\] Figure 5.5 depicts the challenge of integrating UWB and UVDAR.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Situational schema of data fusion.\n\n\nThe UVDAR measurement consists of a position described by cartesian coordinates and orientation described by a quaternion as shown in 5.2 with a corresponding covariance matrix. The measurement is in frame of the camera, but with help of mrs_tranformer the coordinates are transformed to the world coordinates. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n   \\mathrm{position} = \\begin{bmatrix} x & y & z \\end{bmatrix}^T \\qquad \\mathrm{orientation} = \\begin{bmatrix} x & y & z & w \\end{bmatrix}^T\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5.2}\\] For this kind of measurement the linear Kalman filter is the best choice, because there are no nonlinearity functions and the computation cost is low. The rotation from UVDAR is transformed from quaternion to Euler angles. A measurement matrix \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is a simple identity matrix with dimension six.\nThe UWB measurement acquires distance from UAV \\(\\mathbf{x_1}\\) to UAV \\(\\mathbf{x_2}\\) as noted in equation 5.3. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    UWB_{distance} &= \\sqrt{(\\mathbf{x_2 - x_1})^T (\\mathbf{x_2 - x_1})}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5.3}\\] The problem is nonlinear and requires a more complex approach. For this reason, the unscented Kalman filter is employed for fusing distance. The previous state needs to be transformed from world frame to UAV frame. The result needs to be transformed back to world frame back to world. The measurement function is described as a C++ function 5.6.\n\n\n\n\nkalman::range_ukf_t::z_t observe_ukf(\n            const kalman::range_ukf_t::x_t &x)\n{\n    Eigen::VectorXd pose(3);\n\n    pose &lt;&lt; x[(int)STATE::X], \n                x[(int)STATE::Y], \n                x[(int)STATE::Z];\n    kalman::range_ukf_t::z_t z;\n\n    z &lt;&lt; pose.norm();\n    return z;\n}\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Measurement function for fusing distance."
