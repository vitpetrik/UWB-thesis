# Source code {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The attached zip file contains all the source codes, which can also be found in a GitHub repository.

List of source codes:

-   [leader-follower](https://github.com/vitpetrik/leader_follower)

    ROS node that implements the leader-follower algorithm.

-   [Object-tracker-ROS](https://github.com/vitpetrik/leader_follower)

    ROS node for UWB and UVDAR data fusion. Could be used for other types of position/distance sensors as well.

-   [UWB_MRS_ranging_ros_node](https://github.com/vitpetrik/UWB_MRS_ranging_ros_node.git)

    ROS node for communication with DWM1001-DEV.

-   [UWB-MRS-ranging](https://github.com/vitpetrik/UWB-MRS-ranging.git)

    Zephyr RTOS application for DWM1001. The nRF Connect SDK is needed for compilation and flashing.

-   [UWB-workspace](https://github.com/vitpetrik/UWB-workspace)

    Complete ROS Noetic workspace for UWB. Includes all necessary packages with real-world tmux scripts and gazebo simulations.

The source code for the thesis is at <https://github.com/vitpetrik/UWB-thesis> and can be viewed as a web page at <https://vitpetrik.github.io/UWB-thesis/>.

All the source codes are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and should compile right away. In case of any trouble, feel free to contact the author of this thesis at <petrivi2@fel.cvut.cz>, <vit.petrik@gmail.com>, or GitHub.

# Object tracker and UWB evaluation tests {#sec-appendix-ot .unnumbered .unlisted}

Multiple tests were run to evaluate the function of the Object tracker.
As a test environment, the Gazebo simulator was used.
The first UAV, an observer, remained at the coordinates $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix}^T$ for the entire duration of the tests.
The second UAV, a performer, followed a pre-planned trajectory.

Range error is the difference between the ground truth distance between the UAVs and the distance calculated via unscented transform from Object tracker pose estimation.
