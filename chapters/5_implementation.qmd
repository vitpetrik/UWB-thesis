# Implementation on UAV

The proposed measurement system is designed to work with the existing MRS UAV System that has been developed by the MRS group at CTU.
The MRS system relies on the use of the Robot Operating System (ROS) in version ROS Noetic released in 2020[^rosnoetic].

ROS is a robust framework used for developing and controlling robots. 
It provides a variety of tools and libraries that make robot software development easier. 
ROS uses a distributed system, allowing different parts of a robot to communicate with each other using a messaging model. 
It supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to developers. 
ROS has a large community and a wide range of pre-existing packages, making it a popular choice for research and industrial applications.

An overview of the proposed system is shown in figure @fig-system-overview. This thesis implements the blue-colored blocks and these blocks will be further explained in this chapter.
