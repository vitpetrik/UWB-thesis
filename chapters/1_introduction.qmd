In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been rapidly growing due to their versatility and wide range of applications, from aerial photography and surveillance to delivery services [^zipline] and search and rescue operations @petrlik2023uavs. 
The problem of relative localization in UAV swarms is a critical challenge in enabling cooperative behavior and avoiding collisions.

To address this problem, a novel system is proposed in this thesis that combines computer vision and ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for direction and range measurements, respectively. 
By combining these measurements with a Kalman filter, the relative positions and orientations of UAVs can be estimated with high accuracy, even in GNSS-denied environments such as buildings or underground areas @petrlik2023uavs. 
This approach has a significant advantage over existing methods, which often rely on GNSS @6943105 or motion capture [^optitrack] and are therefore limited in their ability to operate in challenging environments or without additional infrastructure onsite.

This thesis addresses designing and implementing an effective relative localization system for UAV swarms using computer vision and UWB technology and evaluates how well it performs in real-world scenarios. 
First, a review of the proposed system and its key components, including the computer vision algorithms for direction estimation and the UWB hardware for range measurement, will be presented. 
Finally, the performance of the system will be evaluated through a series of experiments in both simulated and real-world environments.

By developing and testing this system, a contribution will be made to the growing body of research on multi-robot systems and pave the way for new applications of UAV swarms in challenging environments.
